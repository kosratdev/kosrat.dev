# Introduction to React Native

Welcome to React Native Essentials! In this lesson, we'll explore what React Native is, why it's popular, and how it compares to other mobile development approaches.

## What is React Native?

React Native is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Facebook (now Meta). It allows developers to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React.

### Key Features

- **Cross-platform**: Write once, run on both iOS and Android
- **Native performance**: Uses native components for optimal performance
- **Hot reloading**: See changes instantly during development
- **Large ecosystem**: Leverage the vast npm ecosystem
- **Backed by Meta**: Strong community and corporate support

## Why Choose React Native?

### Advantages

1. **Code Reusability**: Share up to 95% of code between platforms
2. **Faster Development**: Single codebase means faster iteration
3. **Cost Effective**: Fewer developers needed compared to native development
4. **JavaScript Ecosystem**: Use familiar tools and libraries
5. **Native Look and Feel**: Apps feel truly native to each platform

### When to Use React Native

✅ **Good for:**

- MVPs and prototypes
- Apps with standard UI components
- Teams with React/JavaScript experience
- Projects with tight timelines and budgets
- Apps requiring frequent updates

❌ **Consider alternatives for:**

- Performance-critical applications (games, AR/VR)
- Apps requiring extensive platform-specific features
- Teams already experienced in native development
- Apps with complex animations or custom UI
