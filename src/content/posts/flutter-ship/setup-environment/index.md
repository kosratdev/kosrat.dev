# Overview

> "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."
> â€” Abraham Lincoln

After setting up the [Git & GitHub Workflow](../git-github/), it is time to sharpen the axe. Setting up the coding enviroment is one of first crucial steps that should be done in the early stages of development. While the steps we'll cover in this article may seem small, they have a significant impact on your project and lay the foundation for the up articles in this series.

In this post, I will show you how to setup a complete project environment including **package & bundle IDs, flavors, app icons, splash screens, and environment variables** for your Flutter project. As you know, this article is part of the [**Flutter Ship**](../) series, which guides you through shipping a production-ready Flutter app.

By the end of this article, you will learn the following:

1. How to change your app's **package and bundle ID** for proper identification.
2. How to set up different **flavors** for development, staging, and production environments.
3. How to configure different **app icons** for each flavor.
4. How to design and implement **splash screens** for different versions of Android and iOS.
5. How to use **environment variables** (`.env` files) to manage configuration across environments.

If this sounds like what you're looking for, let's dive in!
