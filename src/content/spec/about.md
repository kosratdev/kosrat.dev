His development journey began in **2013** when he identified the need for a prayer app, particularly for the Kurdish people in Iraq. This led to the creation of the **`MyPrayers`** app in **2014** 🎉✌️, which was initially launched on the Google Play Store, followed by other platforms. **`MyPrayers`** has accumulated over one million downloads on the Google Play Store, Huawei App Gallery, and Apple App Store 📈😎💪.

Besides the MyPrayers apps, he also developed a cross-platform package named `MuslimData` for Android, iOS, and Flutter. This package serves the Muslim community by providing prayer times, azkars (Hisnul Muslim), location helpers, and names of Allah, all with support for multiple languages.
